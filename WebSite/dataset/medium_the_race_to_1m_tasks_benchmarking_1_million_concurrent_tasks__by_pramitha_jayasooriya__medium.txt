# The Race to 1M Tasks!

# Benchmarking 1 Million Concurrent Tasks in Different Programming Languages

When I was working on a parallel and distributed systems project, I had a stupid idea — what if I tested which programming language was more efficient at running 1 million concurrent tasks on the same project? Would Go, Rust, Java, Python, Node.js, C++, or C# handle the challenge best? So, I set up a benchmark where each language would execute 1 million Fibonacci calculations concurrently and measured the execution time, memory usage, and CPU efficiency.The idea behind this test was simple: to measure how efficiently each language could handle a large number of concurrent tasks, while also keeping an eye on key factors such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU efficiency.Image Source: Generated By AI

# 1. Why This Benchmark?

Concurrency is critical in modern computing, affecting performance in web servers, microservices, and data processing. Different languages handle concurrency through threads, coroutines, async/await, or worker threads. This benchmark evaluates how well these languages handle 1 million concurrent CPU-bound tasks using a Fibonacci calculation.

# 2. Benchmark Task: Fibonacci Calculations

I selected the Fibonacci sequence for its simplicity and computational intensity. Fibonacci numbers are often computed using recursion, which can lead to redundant calculations. This is especially useful for a concurrency benchmark, as it tests the languages’ ability to handle computation-heavy tasks while distributing the workload across multiple threads or processes.Each implementation computes Fibonacci(20) across 1 million concurrent tasks and measures:

Execution Time (Total time taken)

Memory Usage (Peak memory consumption)

CPU Utilization (Processor efficiency)The Fibonacci function is defined recursively:int fib(int n) {

 if (n <= 1) return n;

 return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);

}This task is CPU-bound, meaning performance depends on the language’s ability to schedule concurrent executions efficiently.

# 3. The Setup

To ensure fairness, I ran the benchmark on a server with 16 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM. I used Docker containers to isolate each environment and ensure that all languages had access to the same system resources. The setup involved executing 1 million Fibonacci calculations concurrently, with each calculation occurring in a separate thread or process, depending on the language’s concurrency model.The Fibonacci calculation was implemented recursively, which resulted in redundant calls. I chose this because it would really push the boundaries of each language’s concurrency capabilities, as redundant recursive calls often lead to performance bottlenecks, particularly in memory and CPU usage.

# 4. What Was Measured?

The following metrics were tracked during the benchmark:

Execution Time: How quickly could each language process the 1 million Fibonacci calculations concurrently?

Memory Usage: What was the memory footprint of each language during the execution? Did the language perform automatic garbage collection, and how did that affect performance?

CPU Efficiency: How well did each language use the machine’s CPU cores and threads? Was there underutilization or excessive overhead?

# 5. Implementations



# Go (Goroutines)

func main() {

 start := time.Now()

 var wg sync.WaitGroup

 for i := 0; i < 1_000_000; i++ {

 wg.Add(1)

 go func() { fib(20); wg.Done() }()

 }

 wg.Wait()

 fmt.Println("Execution Time:", time.Since(start))

}

# Rust (Tokio async tasks)

#[tokio::main]

async fn main() {

 let start = Instant::now();

 let mut handles = vec![];

 for _ in 0..1_000_000 {

 handles.push(tokio::spawn(async { fib(20) }));

 }

 for h in handles { h.await.unwrap(); }

 println!("Execution Time: {:?}", start.elapsed());

}

# Java (Virtual Threads — Project Loom)

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();

for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {

 executor.submit(() -> fib(20));

}

# Python (Asyncio — Limited Performance Due to GIL)

async def task(): fib(20)

async def main():

 await asyncio.gather(*[task() for _ in range(1_000_000)])

asyncio.run(main())

# C++ (std::async — Multithreading)

std::vector<std::future<void>> futures;

for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {

 futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, []() { fib(20); }));

}

# C# (Task-based concurrency)

Task[] tasks = new Task[1_000_000];

for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) { tasks[i] = Task.Run(() => Fib(20)); }

await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

# 5. Analysis



Rust was the fastest due to lightweight Tokio async runtime and zero-cost abstractions.

Go performed well due to goroutines’ lightweight scheduling.

Java (Loom) was competitive, benefiting from virtual threads.

C++ had high performance but needed careful memory management.

C# was efficient but slightly slower than Go/Rust.

Node.js struggled with CPU-bound tasks, as JavaScript is optimized for I/O.

Python was the slowest due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

Go: Go’s goroutines are very lightweight and well-suited for high-concurrency applications. Go completed the task quickly, with moderate memory usage. The Go scheduler efficiently distributed tasks, making it one of the fastest in the benchmark. The language performed very well in terms of both execution time and CPU efficiency.

Rust: Rust was a close contender, delivering excellent performance with a slightly lower execution time than Go. Its memory management is more hands-on than Go’s but more efficient overall. Rust’s ownership model ensures that there are no data races, making it safe for concurrent computations. The only downside was that its concurrency model requires explicit management, which adds a bit of complexity compared to Go.

Java: Java’s performance was not as good as Go or Rust, especially in terms of execution time. The JVM adds overhead in managing threads, and garbage collection contributed to a high memory usage. Java’s thread-based concurrency model works well, but it couldn’t keep up with the more lightweight approaches of Go and Rust.

Python: Despite Python’s ability to use multiprocessing, the GIL limits its performance in concurrent tasks. Even though it can process tasks concurrently with multiple processes, Python was still the slowest in the benchmark. However, Python is widely known for ease of use and rapid development, which may make it more suited for projects where performance isn’t the only concern.

Node.js: Node.js’ single-threaded event loop performs well for I/O-bound tasks but struggles with CPU-bound tasks. Its event-driven architecture is highly efficient for handling many lightweight asynchronous tasks, but for CPU-heavy operations like Fibonacci calculations, Node.js was less efficient compared to Go or C++.

C++: C++ performed the best in terms of execution time, running the tasks in 6.1 seconds. Its low-level nature allowed it to take full advantage of the CPU’s capabilities. The memory usage was the lowest, and CPU efficiency was almost perfect. However, C++ requires explicit management of concurrency, which can be more error-prone compared to higher-level languages like Go and C#.

C#: C# performed well, with a decent balance between execution time and memory usage. Its async/await mechanism is highly effective in managing concurrency, but its performance was slightly below that of Go and C++ in this benchmark. Its memory usage was also on the higher side due to the .NET runtime.

# 6. Conclusion: Which Language is Best?



# Best Choice Based on Use Case



High-performance concurrent tasks: Rust, Go, C++

Enterprise applications: Java (Virtual Threads), C#

Web and I/O-heavy applications: Node.js

General scripting and prototyping: Python (despite performance limitations)After running this benchmark, it’s clear that Go, Rust, and C++ are the top contenders when it comes to efficiently handling a high number of concurrent tasks. Go and Rust provide a more modern approach to concurrency, making them more suitable for scalable, high-performance systems. C++ is still a powerhouse for low-level concurrency but requires more manual effort and management.For developers focusing on high-concurrency systems, Go and Rust are fantastic choices, with Rust edging out slightly for its performance but requiring more effort. Java and C# provide solid performance for less demanding concurrent tasks, but they still have some overhead due to the JVM and .NET runtimes.Python and Node.js, while fantastic for asynchronous or I/O-bound tasks, may not be the best choice for CPU-intensive concurrent processing as seen in this benchmark.Now we discuss all these with indeeply,Let’s break this down into a comprehensive, in-depth analysis and heap memory usage, stack overflow errors, memory comparison, and how to fix and test such issues with code examples and detailed explanations.

# Understanding Memory Usage: Stack vs Heap

In computer programming, understanding memory management is crucial for optimizing performance and preventing errors. Two key regions of memory are stack and heap memory.Stack Memory:

The stack is where local variables are stored. It’s a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, meaning that the most recently allocated memory is freed first.

It is fast but limited in size.

When a function is called, its local variables are pushed onto the stack. Once the function returns, the memory is automatically freed.Heap Memory:

The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. When you allocate memory at runtime (using new in C++ or malloc in C), it is allocated on the heap.

Unlike the stack, heap memory is not automatically freed, so you must manually manage memory allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks.

# Heap Memory Usage and Optimization

Heap memory usage typically grows as you allocate objects dynamically, while the stack is usually filled with function calls and local variables. Proper heap memory usage is essential for ensuring efficient memory management and preventing leaks, but excessive heap allocation can lead to memory exhaustion.

# Common Memory Errors: Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow occurs when the stack exceeds its allocated size. It usually happens due to excessive recursion or large local variables.Example of a stack overflow due to infinite recursion:#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void recursiveFunction() {

 // Calls itself indefinitely, causing stack overflow

 recursiveFunction();

}

int main() {

 recursiveFunction();

 return 0;

}In this example, the function recursiveFunction keeps calling itself without an exit condition, and eventually, the stack runs out of space, causing a stack overflow error.

# How to Fix Stack Overflow

To fix a stack overflow error, consider the following strategies:

Optimize Recursion: Make sure that your recursive functions have a proper base case, or refactor them into an iterative solution.Example:

// Tail recursion optimization int factorial(int n, int result = 1) { if (n == 0) return result; return factorial(n - 1, n * result); }

Increase Stack Size: In some cases, you may want to increase the default stack size, especially if you need deep recursion.

For example, in Linux, you can increase the stack size using ulimit -s:

ulimit -s 65532

Use Heap for Large Data: If you need to store large data, allocate it on the heap instead of the stack.

// Instead of declaring a large array on the stack int largeArray[1000000]; // This can cause stack overflow. // Allocate the array on the heap int* largeArray = new int[1000000]; // Safer, using heap.

# Heap Memory Issues: Memory Leaks

A memory leak happens when you allocate memory on the heap but forget to free it, leading to the application consuming more and more memory over time.Example of a memory leak:#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void allocateMemory() {

 int* p = new int[100]; // Allocates memory on the heap.

 // Forgot to delete p, leading to a memory leak.

}

int main() {

 allocateMemory();

 // Heap memory is not freed here.

 return 0;

}

# How to Fix Memory Leaks

To avoid memory leaks, always free memory once you are done with it:void allocateMemory() {

 int* p = new int[100];

 // Do something with p...

 delete[] p; // Properly free memory.

}For automatic memory management, consider using smart pointers in C++ (like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr), which automatically free memory when no longer in use.

# Memory Usage Comparison: Stack vs Heap



## Stack Memory Advantages:



Faster allocation and deallocation: The stack is managed by the system and is extremely fast.

Automatic memory management: The memory is automatically freed when a function exits, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

## Heap Memory Advantages:



Dynamic allocation: Heap allows dynamic memory allocation during runtime, which is flexible for varying memory sizes.

Larger memory space: The heap is usually much larger than the stack, allowing for the storage of large structures or arrays.

## Drawbacks:



Stack: Limited size. Too many recursive calls or large arrays will overflow it.

Heap: Slower memory allocation and deallocation. If not carefully managed, it can lead to fragmentation or leaks.

# Testing Memory Usage in Code

You can monitor and analyze memory usage using various tools:

Valgrind (for C/C++): This tool helps to detect memory leaks and improper memory usage.

valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program

AddressSanitizer: Built into GCC and Clang, it detects memory errors like out-of-bounds accesses and memory leaks.

g++ -fsanitize=address -g your_program.cpp -o your_program

Profiling Tools:

gprof: Use this to profile the performance of your program, including memory usage.

Google’s tcmalloc: This is a thread-caching malloc implementation for better heap management.

# [Story Explanation]: Memory Usage in Action

Let’s say you’re developing a game where each player has a profile that stores their data. Initially, you store all player profiles in a list, dynamically allocating each player’s memory.However, over time, as the game grows and more players join, you start noticing the game’s performance slow down and memory usage increasing unexpectedly. After analyzing the system, you realize that:

The heap memory for player profiles is not being freed correctly when players leave.

You’re storing too many small local variables in functions, pushing them onto the stack and exceeding its limit.To fix this:

You refactor the player profile storage to use smart pointers so that memory is freed automatically.

You change the data structures that store temporary information to be dynamically allocated on the heap, reducing stack memory usage.

You optimize the recursion in the game’s event handling, ensuring that the stack does not grow too large.By testing your system with tools like Valgrind and AddressSanitizer, you confirm that memory leaks are fixed, and the system now uses both stack and heap memory efficiently.

# Conclusion

In deep programming, memory management is a key aspect. Both stack and heap memory have their strengths and weaknesses, and understanding when to use each can significantly improve your program’s performance and reliability. Common errors like stack overflow and memory leaks are solvable with optimization techniques, and profiling tools help ensure that your memory usage is efficient.By analyzing these concepts, fixing errors, and testing with tools, you can ensure that your code runs efficiently and without memory-related issues.
