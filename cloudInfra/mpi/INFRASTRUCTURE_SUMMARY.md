## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
cd cloudInfra/mpi
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Basic deployment (4 workers, spot instances)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Custom deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh -n production-cluster -w 8 -t c5n.xlarge
```

### 3. Run Distributed Search
```bash
# Run a search across the cluster
./scripts/run-mpi.sh search "machine learning algorithms"

# Monitor cluster performance
./scripts/run-mpi.sh monitor

# Run performance benchmark
./scripts/run-mpi.sh benchmark
```

### 4. Access Web Interface
The deployment provides a load balancer URL for web access where you can:
- Submit search queries through a modern web UI
- Monitor real-time cluster status and performance
- View search results and execution metrics

### 5. Cleanup Resources
```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### Instance Recommendations
| Workload | Master | Workers | Nodes | Est. Cost/Hour | Monthly |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Development | c5n.large | c5n.large | 1+2 | $0.20 | $144 |
| Testing | c5n.xlarge | c5n.large | 1+4 | $0.60 | $432 |
| Production | c5n.2xlarge | c5n.xlarge | 1+8 | $2.40 | $1,728 |

### Cost Savings Features
- **Spot Instances**: Enabled by default (50-70% savings)
- **Auto-shutdown**: Stops idle instances after 60 minutes
- **Right-sizing**: Configurable instance types per workload
- **Regional pricing**: Deploy in cost-effective regions

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Scaling Options
```bash
# Scale worker count
terraform apply -var="worker_count=16"

# Enable auto-scaling
terraform apply -var="enable_autoscaling=true" -var="max_workers=20"

# Change instance types
terraform apply -var="worker_instance_type=c5n.2xlarge"
```
