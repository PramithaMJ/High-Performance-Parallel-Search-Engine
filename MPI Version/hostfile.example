# MPI Hostfile for Distributed Execution
# Format: hostname slots=number_of_processes
# 
# Examples:
# localhost slots=2
# node1.cluster.local slots=4
# node2.cluster.local slots=4
# 192.168.1.100 slots=2
# 192.168.1.101 slots=2

# Default configuration for local testing
localhost slots=2

# Uncomment and modify the following lines for multi-machine setup:
# Replace with your actual machine hostnames or IP addresses

# Machine 1 (Master node)
# master-node slots=4

# Machine 2 (Worker node 1)  
# worker-node-1 slots=4

# Machine 3 (Worker node 2)
# worker-node-2 slots=4

# Machine 4 (Worker node 3) 
# worker-node-3 slots=4

# Notes:
# - Each machine should have MPI installed and configured
# - SSH key-based authentication should be set up between machines
# - The search engine binary should be available on all machines
# - All machines should have access to the same dataset directory
# - Ensure firewall settings allow MPI communication
