# High-Performance Parallel Search Engine: Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

The High-Performance Parallel Search Engine represents a comprehensive exploration of parallel computing paradigms applied to information retrieval. This project implements a search engine with BM25 ranking algorithm using four distinct parallelization approaches:

1. **Serial Version**: Baseline implementation without parallelization
2. **OpenMP Version**: Shared memory parallelism using multi-threading
3. **MPI Version**: Distributed memory parallelism using message passing
4. **Hybrid Version**: Combined OpenMP+MPI approach leveraging both paradigms
5. **CUDA+OpenMP Hybrid Version**: GPU acceleration combined with CPU multi-threading
6. **Super Hybrid Version**: Integration of OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA technologies

This report details the implementation specifics of each version, highlighting the parallelized components, the rationale behind parallelization choices, and the performance considerations for each approach.

## 1. Project Architecture Overview

The search engine consists of several core components that work together to provide efficient document retrieval capabilities:

### 1.1 Core Components

1. **Main (main.c)**: Entry point coordinating program flow and handling user inputs
2. **Crawler (crawler.c)**: Handles website crawling and content extraction
3. **Parser (parser.c)**: Processes documents for indexing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
4. **Index (index.c)**: Manages the inverted index data structure for efficient searching
5. **Ranking (ranking.c)**: Implements BM25 algorithm for relevance-based ranking
6. **Metrics (`metrics.c`)**: Collects and reports performance metrics
7. **Benchmark & Evaluation**: Tools for performance measurement and comparison

### 1.2 Data Flow

1. **Web Crawling Process**:

   - Performs breadth-first traversal from seed URL
   - Extracts links and content from web pages
   - Normalizes URLs to prevent duplicates
   - Saves content as text documents
2. **Indexing Process**:

   - Reads documents from the dataset directory
   - Parses content into tokens
   - Removes stopwords and applies stemming
   - Builds an inverted index with document frequencies
3. **Search Process**:

   - Processes user query (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
   - Searches the inverted index for matching documents
   - Calculates BM25 scores for relevance ranking
   - Returns the top-k results

## 2. Serial Version Implementation

The serial implementation serves as the baseline, processing all operations sequentially with no parallelism.

### 2.1 Key Characteristics

- **Document Processing**: One file at a time
- **Tokenization**: Sequential parsing of document content
- **Indexing**: Sequential updates to the inverted index
- **Search**: Sequential BM25 score calculation for each document
- **Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - Sequential web crawling - cannot download pages in parallel
  - Sequential document parsing and indexing
  - No parallel query processing
  - In-memory index with size limitations

### 2.2 Core Data Structures

```c
// Inverted index data structures
typedef struct {
    int doc_id;
    int freq;
} Posting;

typedef struct {
    char term[64];
    Posting postings[1000];
    int posting_count;
} InvertedIndex;

// Global index variables
InvertedIndex index_data[10000];
int index_size = 0;
```

This structure maps terms (words) to documents containing them, where:

- `term` is the normalized word
- `postings` is an array of document references
- Each posting contains a document ID and the term frequency

## 3. OpenMP Version Implementation

The OpenMP version introduces shared-memory parallelism using multi-threading.

### 3.1 Parallelized Components

#### 3.1.1 Index Building (index.c)

```c
// Process all files in parallel
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) reduction(+ : successful_docs)
for (int i = 0; i < file_count; i++) {
    int thread_id = omp_get_thread_num();
    printf("Thread %d processing file: %s\n", thread_id, file_paths[i]);
  
    if (parse_file_parallel(file_paths[i], i)) {
        // Thread-safe update of document metadata
        #pragma omp critical(doc_metadata)
        {
            strncpy(documents[i].filename, file_paths[i], MAX_FILENAME_LEN - 1);
            documents[i].filename[MAX_FILENAME_LEN - 1] = '\0';
        }
        successful_docs++;
    }
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- File processing is an embarrassingly parallel task - each file can be processed independently
- Document parsing is I/O and CPU intensive
- No dependencies between documents during initial parsing

**Critical sections:**

- This section protects the shared `documents` array from race conditions when multiple threads update it concurrently

#### 3.1.2 Term Indexing and Document Length Updates

```c
// Adding a token to the index (called during parsing)
void add_token(const char *token, int doc_id) {
    // Start timing
    start_timer();
  
    // Protect the shared index structure
    omp_set_lock(&index_lock);
  
    // Index update logic...
  
    omp_unset_lock(&index_lock);
  
    // Update document length
    omp_set_lock(&doc_length_lock);
    doc_lengths[doc_id]++;
    omp_unset_lock(&doc_length_lock);
  
    // Record tokenizing time
    metrics.tokenizing_time += stop_timer();
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Uses OpenMP locks instead of critical sections for finer-grained control
- Two separate locks for different shared resources (index and document lengths)

**Critical points:**

- The inverted index structure is a shared resource - requires synchronization
- Document length tracking needs protection from concurrent updates

#### 3.1.3 Web Crawling (crawler.c)

**Why parallelized:**

- HTML parsing is computationally expensive
- Extracting links from different sections of HTML can be done in parallel
- Link extraction doesn't modify the original HTML content

**Critical sections:**

- URL queue management needs protection to prevent corruption of the queue data structure

#### 3.1.4 BM25 Ranking (ranking.c)

```c
// Parallel result string formatting for efficiency
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) if(items_to_process > 10)
for (int i = 0; i < items_to_process; ++i) {
    if (results[i].score > 0) {
        const char* filename = get_doc_filename(results[i].doc_id);
        snprintf(result_strings[i], 255, "#%d: %s (Score: %.4f)", 
                 i+1, filename, results[i].score);
        #pragma omp atomic
        results_found++;
    }
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- BM25 score calculation for each document is independent
- Query processing is often a bottleneck in search engines
- Score calculations involve floating-point operations that benefit from parallel execution

**Critical section:**

- Score accumulation in the results array needs protection to prevent race conditions

#### 3.1.5 Term Search (index.c)

```c
// Parallel search for a term in the index
int parallel_search_term(const char *term, Posting **results, int *result_count) {
    // Initialize results...
    int found = -1;

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < index_size; i++) {
        if (strcmp(index_data[i].term, term) == 0) {
            #pragma omp critical(search_result)
            {
                if (found == -1) { // Only set if not already found
                    found = i;
                }
            }
        }
    }
  
    // Process results...
    return found;
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Term matching across a large index is computationally expensive
- First-match semantics are preserved with the critical section
- Multiple threads can search different parts of the index simultaneously

**Critical point:**

- Updating the `found` variable needs synchronization to ensure only the first match is recorded

#### 3.1.6 Index Clearing and Initialization

```c
// Clear the index for rebuilding
void clear_index() {
    #pragma omp parallel sections
    {
        #pragma omp section
        {
            // Reset index data
            index_size = 0;
        }

        #pragma omp section
        {
            // Reset document lengths
            memset(doc_lengths, 0, sizeof(doc_lengths));
        }

        #pragma omp section
        {
            // Reset documents array
            memset(documents, 0, sizeof(documents));
        }
    }
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Different memory areas can be initialized independently
- Memory operations benefit from parallel execution
- Parallel sections allow different threads to handle different initialization tasks

### 3.2 Non-Parallelized Components and Rationale

#### 3.2.1 Index Structure Management

The core index structure manipulation is protected by locks but not fully parallelized because:

- The inverted index has complex dependencies between terms
- The structure has inherent sequential nature for insertion and lookup
- It's more efficient to use fine-grained locks than to attempt full parallelization

#### 3.2.2 Parser Initialization

This function is not parallelized internally because:

- File operations are primarily I/O bound
- The parallelism happens at a higher level (multiple files processed in parallel)
- The overhead of parallelizing small operations would outweigh benefits

#### 3.2.3 URL Normalization

URL normalization remains sequential because:

- It's a relatively lightweight string manipulation operation
- Has internal dependencies within a single URL
- Parallelizing would introduce overhead for minimal benefit

### 3.3 Critical Points in OpenMP Implementation

#### 3.3.1 OpenMP Lock Initialization

```c
// Initialize OpenMP locks
void init_locks()
{
    omp_init_lock(&index_lock);
    omp_init_lock(&doc_length_lock);
}

// Destroy OpenMP locks
void destroy_locks()
{
    omp_destroy_lock(&index_lock);
    omp_destroy_lock(&doc_length_lock);
}
```

These functions properly initialize and clean up OpenMP locks, which is critical for correct program behavior.

#### 3.3.2 Thread Count Management

```c
// Check for OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable
int thread_count = 4; // Default number of threads
char* env_thread_count = getenv("OMP_NUM_THREADS");
if (env_thread_count != NULL) {
    int env_threads = atoi(env_thread_count);
    if (env_threads > 0) {
        thread_count = env_threads;
        printf("Using thread count from OMP_NUM_THREADS: %d\n", thread_count);
    }
}

// Apply initial thread count setting
omp_set_num_threads(thread_count);

// Disable dynamic adjustment for more consistent thread allocation
omp_set_dynamic(0);
```

These settings are critical for:

- Allowing user control over parallelism
- Ensuring consistent thread allocation
- Supporting nested parallel regions

#### 3.3.3 Load Balancing

```c
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
```

The choice of dynamic scheduling is critical for:

- Balancing workloads across threads
- Adapting to varying processing times for different files/URLs
- Ensuring efficient thread utilization

### 3.4 Performance Considerations for Parallel Indexing

#### 3.4.1 Lock Contention

The main bottleneck in parallel indexing is lock contention:

- Each token addition requires acquiring the index lock
- High-frequency terms will cause more contention
- Solutions include:
  - Thread-local indexes (as described above)
  - Sharding the index by term prefix for less contention
  - Batching updates to reduce lock acquisition frequency

#### 3.4.2 Memory Allocation Overhead

Memory allocation inside critical sections can be expensive:

- The implementation expands the postings array and index array dynamically
- Potential solutions:
  - Pre-allocate larger chunks to reduce reallocation frequency
  - Use a custom memory pool allocator
  - Perform batch reallocations outside critical sections when possible

#### 3.4.3 Load Balancing

Document processing times can vary significantly:

- Dynamic scheduling helps distribute work more evenly
- Monitoring thread utilization helps identify imbalances
- Chunking large documents could provide finer-grained load balancing

## 4. MPI Version Implementation

The MPI version extends parallelism across multiple nodes using distributed memory and message passing.

### 4.1 Distributed Architecture

```c
// Main function initializing MPI environment
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int rank, size;
  
    // Initialize MPI
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
  
    // Initialize the new components
    init_mpi_comm();
    init_load_balancer(size);
  
    // Set up global distributed index and parallel processor
    extern DistributedIndex* dist_index;
    extern ParallelProcessor* processor;
    dist_index = create_distributed_index(rank, size);
    processor = create_parallel_processor(rank, size);
  
    // ...
}
```

### 4.2 Parallelized Components

#### 4.2.1 Document Distribution

```c
// Calculate work distribution for each process (static distribution)
int files_per_process = file_count / mpi_size;
int remaining_files = file_count % mpi_size;
int start_idx = mpi_rank * files_per_process + (mpi_rank < remaining_files ? mpi_rank : remaining_files);
int end_idx = start_idx + files_per_process + (mpi_rank < remaining_files ? 1 : 0);
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Documents can be partitioned and processed independently across nodes
- Allows scaling beyond the memory limitations of a single machine
- Different nodes can process different parts of the document collection simultaneously

**Implementation details:**

- Documents are evenly distributed across MPI processes
- Each process handles a subset of the document collection
- Load balancing ensures fair work distribution

#### 4.2.2 Distributed Indexing

```c
// Process each file in our assigned range
for (int i = start_idx; i < end_idx; i++) {
    printf("Process %d processing file: %s\n", mpi_rank, file_paths[i]);
    if (parse_file_parallel(file_paths[i], i)) {
        // Store document metadata
        strncpy(documents[i].filename, file_paths[i], MAX_FILENAME_LEN - 1);
        documents[i].filename[MAX_FILENAME_LEN - 1] = '\0';
        local_successful++;
    }
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Index building is compute-intensive and can be distributed
- Each node can maintain a local index for its document subset
- Reduces the memory footprint on each node

**Implementation details:**

- Each MPI process builds a local index for its assigned documents
- Index data is later merged for a complete view
- Document metadata is synchronized across all processes

#### 4.2.3 Distributed Search

```c
// Broadcast the query from rank 0 to all processes
MPI_Bcast(user_query, sizeof(user_query), MPI_CHAR, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

// All processes participate in search, but only rank 0 shows results
rank_bm25(user_query, total_docs, 10);

// Synchronize all processes before calculating metrics
MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Each node can search its local index in parallel
- Query latency can be reduced by parallel processing
- Results can be gathered and merged for final ranking

**Implementation details:**

- The search query is broadcast to all processes
- Each process searches its local index
- Results are gathered and merged by rank 0
- Uses custom MPI datatype for efficient result gathering

#### 4.2.4 Parallel Processing Framework

```c
// Process documents in parallel
void process_documents_parallel(ParallelProcessor* processor, 
                             char file_paths[][256], 
                             int file_count, 
                             ProcessorCallback callback) {
    int rank = processor->mpi_rank;
    int size = processor->mpi_size;
  
    // Master-worker pattern for dynamic work distribution
    if (rank == 0) {
        // Master process - distribute work
        // ...
    } else {
        // Worker process - receive work and process it
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Why parallelized:**

- Provides a flexible framework for parallel document processing
- Supports dynamic load balancing
- Handles communication and synchronization automatically

**Implementation details:**

- Master-worker pattern for dynamic work distribution
- Workers request new tasks when they finish their current work
- Efficient task assignment with low communication overhead

### 4.3 MPI Communication Patterns

#### 4.3.1 Point-to-Point Communication

```c
// Send term to owner
MPI_Request request;
MPI_Isend(buffer, DIST_MAX_TERM_LENGTH + 2 * sizeof(int), MPI_CHAR, 
         owner, DIST_INDEX_TAG, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &request);
add_request(request);
```

Used for:

- Distributing work items between master and workers
- Sending terms to their owner processes in the distributed index
- Notifying the master about completed tasks

#### 4.3.2 Collective Communication

```c
// Broadcast the query from rank 0 to all processes
MPI_Bcast(user_query, sizeof(user_query), MPI_CHAR, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

// Gather all counts to all processes
MPI_Allgather(&local_count, 1, MPI_INT, all_counts, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

// Broadcast merged index to all processes
MPI_Bcast(index_data, merged_size * sizeof(InvertedIndex), MPI_BYTE, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
```

Used for:

- Broadcasting queries to all processes
- Gathering search results from all processes
- Synchronizing global state (document filenames, index data)
- Collective operations like calculating global statistics

#### 4.3.3 Custom MPI Types and Optimizations

```c
// Create MPI datatype for Result struct
MPI_Datatype MPI_RESULT_TYPE;
MPI_Type_contiguous(sizeof(Result), MPI_BYTE, &MPI_RESULT_TYPE);
MPI_Type_commit(&MPI_RESULT_TYPE);
```

Used for:

- Efficient transfer of complex data structures
- Reducing communication overhead
- Simplifying message passing of custom types

### 4.4 Load Balancing Strategies

```c
// Calculate optimal work distribution based on node ID
int files_per_process = *file_count / mpi_size;
int remaining_files = *file_count % mpi_size;

// Each process gets its portion of files with load balancing
*start_idx = mpi_rank * files_per_process + (mpi_rank < remaining_files ? mpi_rank : remaining_files);
*end_idx = *start_idx + files_per_process + (mpi_rank < remaining_files ? 1 : 0);
```

The MPI version implements several load balancing strategies:

1. **Static Distribution**:

   - Divides work evenly among processes based on file count
   - Simple but may lead to imbalance if files vary in size or complexity
2. **Dynamic Distribution**:

   - Master-worker pattern with on-demand work assignment
   - Workers request new work when they complete their current tasks
   - Better adapts to varying processing times
3. **File Size-based Distribution**:

   - Considers file sizes for more balanced workload distribution
   - Aims for equal bytes processed rather than equal file counts

### 4.5 Index Merging and Synchronization

```c
// Function to merge index data from all MPI processes
void merge_mpi_index() {
    // First, gather the size of each process's index
    int all_sizes[32] = {0};  // Assume max 32 processes
    MPI_Allgather(&index_size, 1, MPI_INT, all_sizes, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
  
    // Process 0 will collect all index data
    // ...
  
    // Broadcast merged index to all processes
    MPI_Bcast(index_data, merged_size * sizeof(InvertedIndex), MPI_BYTE, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    MPI_Bcast(&index_size, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
  
    // Synchronize document filenames across all processes
    // ...
}
```

**Why critical:**

- Each process builds a local index that must be merged for global searching
- Duplicate terms across processes need to be merged efficiently
- All processes need a consistent view of the global index

## 5. Hybrid Version (MPI+OpenMP) Implementation

The Hybrid version combines MPI for distributed parallelism across nodes with OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism within each node.

### 5.1 Two-Level Parallelism Architecture

```c
// MPI level parallelism for document distribution
int files_per_process = file_count / mpi_size;
int remaining_files = file_count % mpi_size;
int start_idx = mpi_rank * files_per_process + (mpi_rank < remaining_files ? mpi_rank : remaining_files);
int end_idx = start_idx + files_per_process + (mpi_rank < remaining_files ? 1 : 0);

// OpenMP level parallelism for processing assigned documents
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) reduction(+ : local_successful)
for (int i = start_idx; i < end_idx; i++) {
    int thread_id = omp_get_thread_num();
    printf("Process %d, Thread %d processing file: %s\n", mpi_rank, thread_id, file_paths[i]);
  
    if (parse_file_parallel(file_paths[i], i)) {
        // Thread-safe update of document metadata
        // ...
        local_successful++;
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Key Hybrid Optimizations

#### 5.2.1 Hierarchical Parallelism

```c
// Function to visualize MPI and OpenMP hierarchy
void visualize_hybrid_structure(int mpi_rank, int mpi_size, int omp_threads) {
    // Only rank 0 prints the visualization
    if (mpi_rank == 0) {
        printf("\n╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n");
        printf("║     Hybrid Parallel Crawling Architecture     ║\n");
        printf("╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣\n");
        printf("║ Total MPI Processes: %-3d                     ║\n", mpi_size);
        printf("║ OpenMP Threads per Process: %-3d              ║\n", omp_threads);
        printf("║ Total Parallel Units: %-3d                    ║\n", mpi_size * omp_threads);
        printf("╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝\n");
    }
}
```

**Why implemented:**

- Maximizes parallelism across both distributed and shared memory
- Leverages the strengths of both paradigms
- Better resource utilization across compute clusters

**Implementation details:**

- MPI processes distributed across nodes
- Each MPI process uses OpenMP threads on its node
- Two levels of parallelism for different granularities of work

#### 5.2.2 Hybrid Index Building

```c
// MPI level distribution
distribute_files_across_nodes(folder_path, file_paths, &file_count, &start_idx, &end_idx);

// OpenMP level parallelism
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) reduction(+ : local_successful)
for (int i = start_idx; i < end_idx; i++) {
    // Process each document with thread parallelism
}

// Synchronize using MPI
MPI_Allreduce(&local_successful, &successful_docs, 1, MPI_INT, MPI_SUM, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
```

**Why hybrid approach:**

- Distributes the document corpus across nodes (MPI)
- Processes documents in parallel on each node (OpenMP)
- Combines results using MPI collective operations
- Scales both vertically (more cores per node) and horizontally (more nodes)

#### 5.2.3 Hybrid Query Processing

```c
// Broadcast query to all MPI processes
MPI_Bcast(user_query, sizeof(user_query), MPI_CHAR, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

// OpenMP parallelism within each process for BM25 scoring
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
for (int i = 0; i < num_docs; i++) {
    // Calculate BM25 score using multiple threads
}

// Gather results from all MPI processes
MPI_Gather(local_results, local_top, MPI_RESULT_TYPE,
          global_results, local_top, MPI_RESULT_TYPE, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
```

**Why hybrid approach:**

- Each MPI process handles a subset of the document collection
- OpenMP threads within each process work on different documents
- Results are gathered and merged across all processes
- Provides efficient use of both distributed and shared memory resources

#### 5.2.4 URL Crawling with Hybrid Parallelism

```c
// Distribute URLs across MPI processes
mpi_share_urls(queue, depth, &front, &rear, max_queue_size, mpi_rank, mpi_size, has_visited, mark_visited);

// Process URLs using OpenMP threads within each process
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) shared(downloaded_count)
for (int i = local_front; i <= local_rear; i++) {
    int thread_id = omp_get_thread_num();
    // Download and process URL with thread parallelism
}

// Gather global statistics
mpi_gather_stats(local_downloaded_count, &global_downloaded_count, mpi_size);
```

**Why hybrid approach:**

- Distributes URL crawling across multiple nodes
- Uses thread parallelism for concurrent downloads and processing
- Shares discovered URLs across processes
- Scales to large web crawling tasks efficiently

### 5.3 Resource Optimization

```c
// Apply initial thread count setting based on hardware
omp_set_num_threads(thread_count);

// Disable dynamic adjustment for more consistent thread allocation
omp_set_dynamic(0);

// Enable nested parallelism if available
omp_set_nested(1);
```

The hybrid implementation includes several optimizations:

1. **Memory Efficiency**:

   - Each MPI process only stores its local subset of documents
   - OpenMP threads share memory within each process
   - Reduces redundant storage across threads
2. **Communication Reduction**:

   - Minimizes inter-node communication by using shared memory within nodes
   - Uses efficient MPI collectives for necessary communication
   - Batches communication operations where possible
3. **Load Balancing**:

   - MPI-level load balancing across nodes
   - OpenMP dynamic scheduling for load balancing within nodes
   - Adaptive work distribution based on process and thread performance
4. **Resource Tuning**:

   - Configurable MPI process count via `-np` parameter
   - Configurable OpenMP thread count via `-t` parameter
   - Can be optimized based on the specific hardware configuration

## 6. CUDA+OpenMP Hybrid Version Implementation

The CUDA+OpenMP Hybrid version combines GPU acceleration using CUDA with CPU multi-threading using OpenMP.

### 6.1 GPU-Accelerated Components

#### 6.1.1 Document Tokenization

```cu
__global__ void gpu_tokenize_documents_kernel(
    char* documents, int* doc_offsets, int* doc_lengths,
    char* tokens, int* token_offsets, int* token_counts,
    int num_docs, int max_tokens_per_doc) {
  
    int doc_idx = blockIdx.x;
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
  
    if (doc_idx >= num_docs) return;
  
    // Collaborative tokenization using thread block
    // ...
}
```

**Why GPU-accelerated:**

- Tokenization is highly parallelizable at character and word level
- GPUs excel at processing large numbers of small, independent tasks
- Can process thousands of documents simultaneously
- Memory-bound operation benefits from high GPU memory bandwidth

#### 6.1.2 BM25 Scoring

```cu
__global__ void gpu_bm25_scoring_kernel(
    float* doc_vectors, float* query_vector, float* scores,
    int* doc_lengths, float avg_doc_length, float k1, float b,
    int num_docs, int num_terms) {
  
    int doc_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  
    if (doc_idx >= num_docs) return;
  
    float score = 0.0f;
    int doc_length = doc_lengths[doc_idx];
  
    for (int term_idx = 0; term_idx < num_terms; term_idx++) {
        float tf = doc_vectors[doc_idx * num_terms + term_idx];
        float idf = query_vector[term_idx];
    
        if (tf > 0.0f && idf > 0.0f) {
            float norm_factor = tf / (tf + k1 * (1.0f - b + b * doc_length / avg_doc_length));
            score += idf * norm_factor;
        }
    }
  
    scores[doc_idx] = score;
}
```

```cu
__global__ void gpu_string_matching_kernel(
    char* haystack, char* needle, int* match_positions,
    int haystack_length, int needle_length) {
  
    int pos = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  
    if (pos > haystack_length - needle_length) return;
  
    // Check if needle matches at position pos
    bool match = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < needle_length; i++) {
        if (haystack[pos + i] != needle[i]) {
            match = false;
            break;
        }
    }

}
```

for (int i = 0; i < file_count; i++) {
    int thread_id = omp_get_thread_num();
    char *file_content = malloc(10000);
  
    if (file_content) {
        FILE *file = fopen(file_paths[i], "r");
        if (file) {
            // Read file content
            int content_length = fread(file_content, 1, 9999, file);
            file_content[content_length] = '\0';
            fclose(file);
        
            // Process the file content with OpenMP
            // ...
        }
        free(file_content);
    }
}
```

**Why CPU-managed:**

```c
// Allocate GPU memory
float *d_doc_vectors, *d_query_vector, *d_scores;
int *d_doc_lengths;

size_t doc_vectors_size = num_docs * num_terms * sizeof(float);
size_t query_vector_size = num_terms * sizeof(float);
size_t scores_size = num_docs * sizeof(float);
size_t doc_lengths_size = num_docs * sizeof(int);

cudaMalloc(&d_doc_vectors, doc_vectors_size);
cudaMalloc(&d_query_vector, query_vector_size);
cudaMalloc(&d_scores, scores_size);
cudaMalloc(&d_doc_lengths, doc_lengths_size);

// Copy data to GPU
cudaMemcpy(d_doc_vectors, doc_vectors, doc_vectors_size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < num_docs; i++) {
    results[i].doc_id = i;
    results[i].score = scores[i];
}

// Sort results
qsort(results, num_docs, sizeof(Result), compare_results);
```

**Why CPU-managed:**

    // Launch GPU kernels for parallel processing
    // ...
  
    double gpu_end = omp_get_wtime();
    g_metrics.gpu_time += (gpu_end - gpu_start);
}
#endif

// CPU processing phase
if (g_config.use_openmp) {
    // OpenMP: Multi-threaded CPU processing
    double cpu_start = omp_get_wtime();
  
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic)
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { // Placeholder for actual processing
            // Parallel BM25 scoring, document ranking, etc.
        }
    }
  
    double cpu_end = omp_get_wtime();
    g_metrics.cpu_time += (cpu_end - cpu_start);
}
```

// GPU batch processing
// ...
double cuda_end_time = get_current_time();
g_indexing_metrics.cuda_time += (cuda_end_time - cuda_start_time);
#endif

// OpenMP multi-threading for CPU processing
#ifdef USE_OPENMP
double openmp_start_time = get_current_time();
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic, 1)
for (int i = start_file; i < end_file; i++) {
    // Thread-parallel processing
    // ...
}
double openmp_end_time = get_current_time();
g_indexing_metrics.openmp_time += (openmp_end_time - openmp_start_time);

    }
  
    // Optimize GPU/CPU ratio based on available hardware
    #ifdef USE_CUDA
    if (g_config.use_cuda && g_config.cuda_devices > 0) {
        // More GPUs = higher GPU ratio
        g_config.gpu_cpu_ratio = 0.6f + (0.3f * g_config.cuda_devices / 4.0f);
        if (g_config.gpu_cpu_ratio > 0.9f) g_config.gpu_cpu_ratio = 0.9f;
    } else {
        g_config.gpu_cpu_ratio = 0.0f; // CPU only
    }
    #else
    g_config.gpu_cpu_ratio = 0.0f; // CPU only
    #endif
  
    // Optimize batch size based on available memory
    if (g_config.use_cuda) {
        // Adjust batch size based on GPU memory

    if (!g_cuda_initialized) return -1;
  
    if (g_memory_pool) {
        cudaFree(g_memory_pool);
    }
  
    cudaError_t status = cudaMalloc(&g_memory_pool, pool_size);
    if (status != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA: Failed to allocate memory pool: %s\n", 
                cudaGetErrorString(status));
        return -1;
    }
  
    g_memory_pool_size = pool_size;
    printf("CUDA: Allocated memory pool of %.1f MB\n",
