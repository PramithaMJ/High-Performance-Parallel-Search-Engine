# Medium URL Memory Management Fixes

## Problem Summary
Double-free error occurs when crawling Medium URLs, especially profile URLs like https://medium.com/@lpramithamj.

## Root Causes
1. Inconsistent normalization of URLs leads to same URL being processed multiple times
2. Thread-safety issues with URL normalization function
3. Lack of proper validation for Medium-specific URL patterns
4. Double-freeing of memory due to improper tracking of processed URLs

## Fixed Components

1. normalize_url function:
   - Added thread-local static buffer with __thread keyword
   - Always initialize buffer to prevent garbage data
   - Added special handling for Medium profile URLs (@username)
   - Improved handling of URL fragments and query parameters

2. is_valid_crawl_url function:
   - Added normalization of URLs before comparison
   - Added exclusion of problematic Medium paths (signin, account pages)
   - Better validation of Medium profile and article URLs

3. URL processing:
   - Added deduplication of URLs using normalized forms
   - Added pauses between Medium URL requests to prevent rate limiting
   - Fixed double-free issues by consistently marking processed URLs

## Testing
- Created test_medium_urls.c to verify URL normalization
- Created test_url_normalization.c for basic URL cleanup tests
- Test confirms proper handling of various Medium URL formats

## Impact
- Fixed medium.com/@username URL crawling
- Eliminated double-free memory errors
- Better URL normalization and deduplication
- Improved rate limiting for Medium API requests
