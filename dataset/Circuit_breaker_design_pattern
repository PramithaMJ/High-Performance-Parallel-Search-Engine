Circuit  breaker  pattern  can  prevent  cascading  failures particularly  in  distributed  systems . &#91; 1 &#93; In  distributed  systems,  the  Circuit  Breaker  pattern  can  be  used  to  monitor  service  health  and  can  detect  failures  dynamically.  Unlike  timeout -based  methods,  which  can  lead  to  delayed  error  responses  or  the  premature  failure  of  healthy  requests,  the  Circuit  Breaker  pattern  can  proactively  identify  unresponsive  services  and  can  prevent  repeated  attempts.  This  approach  can  enhance  the  user  experience.  &#91; 2 &#93; The  circuit  breaker  pattern  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  other  patterns,  such  as  retry,  fallback,  and  timeout,  to  enhance  fault  tolerance  in  systems.  &#91; 3 &#93; Challenges [ edit ] According  to  Marc  Brooker,  circuit  breakers  can  misinterpret  a  partial  failure  as  total  system  failure  and  inadvertently  bring  down  the  entire  system.  In  particular,  sharded  systems  and  cell-based  architectures  are  vulnerable  to  this  issue.  A  workaround  is  that  the  server  indicates  to  the  client  which  specific  part  is  overloaded  and  the  client  uses  a  corresponding  mini  circuit  breaker.  However,  this  workaround  can  be  complex  and  expensive. &#91; 4 &#93; &#91; 5 &#93; Different  states  of  circuit  breaker [ edit ] Closed Open Half-open Closed  state [ edit ] Closed  state When  everything  is  normal,  the  circuit  breakers  remain  closed ,  and  all  the  requests  pass  through  to  the  services.  If  the  number  of  failures  increases  beyond  the  threshold,  the  circuit  breaker  trips  and  goes  into  an  open state.
 Open  state [ edit ] Open  state In  this  state  circuit  breaker  returns  an  error  immediately  without  even  invoking  the  services.  The  Circuit  breakers  move  into  the  half-open state  after  a  timeout  period  elapses.  Usually,  it  will  have  a  monitoring  system  where  the  timeout  will  be  specified.
 Half-open  state [ edit ] Half-open  state In  this  state,  the  circuit  breaker  allows  a  limited  number  of  requests  from  the  service  to  pass  through  and  invoke  the  operation.  If  the  requests  are  successful,  then  the  circuit  breaker  will  go  to  the  closed state.  However,  if  the  requests  continue  to  fail,  then  it  goes  back  to  open state.
